> A karma-free Reddit experience

**Note**: This extension currently only works on the old Reddit interface ([https://old.reddit.com/](https://old.reddit.com/)).

Feel free to disable any settings that you don't like under the extension's settings page.

Obviously, this extension doesn't change Reddit's platform and scoring, so posts toward the top are naturally going to be rated higher. The goal here is to eliminate your fixation on karma and to create a more healthy browsing (and posting) experience that isn't biased by karma.
